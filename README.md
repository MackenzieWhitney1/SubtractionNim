# SubtractionNim
Read "theory" for general problem statement and example.
This is meant to be a utility to solve the nim game by printing optimal play.

TestSpace shows example use of functions show_stat_block and show_optimal_play

show_stat_block gives a word based explanation on what the most rational move is from a given position
show_optimal_play shows the entire chain of moves when the game is played optimally.
